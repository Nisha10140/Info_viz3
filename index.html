        <h5>Water Resource Strains in Data Center Hubs</h5>
        <p>Data centers, essential for urban digital infrastructure, heavily rely on water for cooling systems. Could this significant consumption lead to groundwater depletion and increased competition for water resources in cities?</p>

            <h5>What is a Data Center?</h5>
            <p>Think of a data center as the heart of a network. They provide a central location to house servers that collect, store, and process data,
                which companies access remotely via the Internet or over private networks. Data centers provide all the required elements to support
                servers: storage, bockup and recovery, power, cooling, security and physical protection.</p>

        <p>Of course, a data centre needs electricity.
            In the illustration below, where the lines indicate the flow of resources, we can see that electricity is typically provided by a power plant.
            Consuming water and rejecting wasted water requires water treatment before consumption and after wastewater rejection. 
            This also implies using more water to treat the wasted water. 
            Reducing the amount of water used for cooling directly impacts the amount of water required for treatment and disposal.
            Logically, the more electricity is produced for the datacenter by the power plant, the more water is used, and the more emissions are produced. 
            Therefore, the water footprint of a datacenter is the sum of this entire system which works to keep it in operation.</p>

            <p> According to <a href="https://www.fnfresearch.com/data-center-deployment-spending-market">Facts & Factors Share Global Analysis Report</a> : The demand for data centre colocation is projected to rise at a CAGR(compound Annual Growth Rate) of 14.9% from 2024 to 2034.
                The rapid increase in digital transactions, OTT streaming, and upcoming 5G technologies may drive higher data center usage, leading to increased water consumption.

            <p>Water Usage Effectiveness is calculated as the ratio between water used at the data center and electricity delivered to the IT hardware. 
                According to a US Department of Energy report, the WUE of an average data center is 1.8L per 1kWh. 
                Data centers with a WUE of 0.2 L/kWh or less use less than one cup of water for every kilowatt-hour delivered to servers.</p>
